    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="me.jpg" class="me">
    <div class="aboutbox"><p> I am a 3rd year at Virginia Commonwealth University. I am a Graphic Design major with a minor in Anthropology.I currently consider myself a Graphic Designer but I never always saw myself as one. I came into the art department at VCU thinking I was going utilize my drawing and painting strengths in a Communication Arts or Painting and Printmaking degree. However, being told multiple times growing up that it was difficult to make a living from art scared me into being greedy for myself. I chose Graphic Design with the ignorant mindset that Graphic Design was a “modern, relevant art form” that would benefit me the most financially. My mindset as an artist and a designer has drastically changed since I declared my major.

    Going into this field has been a huge learning experience for me and a time of personal growth. Since the beginning of my classes, I started exploring graphic design opportunities, and this is when I began to uncover the enigmatic intricacies of this field. Moreover, I am starting to understand the role of the Graphic Designer in effectuating social hierarchies, preserving community heritage, and promoting seemingly diametric relationships. As an example of social hierarchies, logos, in a way, have the power to generate creative hierarchies. After creation, a logo becomes a symbol for large sections of history, or entire organizations, or linguistic communities. The meanings they generate determine importances in a society. Principally, Graphic Designers are problem solvers, and I feel an important aspect of our job is to understand and research before creating for communities and individuals. This is why I want to use an anthropological perspective within my work. I believe I will foster stronger relationships with my clientele if I adequately represent their identities within my work.
 My current intent as a Graphic Designer is to educate, inform, and create in order to bring to light the beneficial fluidity of Graphic Design, and the higher social impact this field has on collective communities. I am currently a 3rd year at Virginia Commonwealth University. I am a Graphic Design major with a minor in Anthropology. My artistic roots began with drawing and painting, specifically, realistic portraiture and interpretive self explorative paintings. Going through the art program at VCU has made me more familiar with my strengths and weaknesses as an artist, as well as my artistic style. While I originally decided to go into the field of Graphic Design for practicality, I started to deep dive into the many intricacies of Graphic Design.  </p></div>
